# Best Practices
In Arity applications and partner applications, here are some of the best practices we follow to ensure a good end user experience.

## Running the SDK in a Background Service
It's a good idea to run the Drive Engine in a background service so it can keep running outside of when the user has your app open. You can learn to do so in this section for [Android](run-background-service/Android.html) and [iOS](run-background-service/iOS.html)
