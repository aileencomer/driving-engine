# Best Practices
In Arity applications and partner applications, here are some of the best practices we follow to ensure a good end user experience.

## Running the SDK in a Background Service
It's a good idea to run the Drive Engine in a background service so it can keep running outside of when the user has your app open. You can learn to do so in this section for [Android](background-service/Android.md) and [iOS](background-service/iOS.md)

## UX Guidelines
In this [section](ux-guidelines/Indexmd), you'll learn more about ways to ensure a good end user experience for your app.

## Location Service Considerations
With the release of Android O and iOS 11, developers have to be more mindful of location usage. You can learn about how to do so for [Android](location-service-considerations/Android.md) and [iOS](location-service-considerations/iOS.md)
