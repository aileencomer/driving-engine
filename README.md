# Arity Drive Engine SDK
The Drive Engine SDK allows developers to gain insights into how a driver is operating their car. At Arity, we use this information to make informed decisions about driving behavior

## Features
Using the Drive Engine SDK, you'll be able to:
* Detect when a user starts and stops driving their car
