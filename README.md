# Arity Drive Engine SDK
The Drive Engine SDK allows developers to gain insights into how a driver is operating their car. At Arity, we use this information to make informed decisions about driving behavior.

**_PLEASE NOTE_**
**_This documentation is a work in progress. Sections may not exist or may drastically change before finalized._**

## Features
Using the Drive Engine SDK, you'll be able to:
* Detect when a user starts and stops driving their car
* Detect hard accelerations
* Detect hard braking
* Detect when a user is speeding
* Get 1Hz GPS trails for a trip
* View histograms of driving speed, acceleration, and braking
