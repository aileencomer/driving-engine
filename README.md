# Arity Driving Engine SDK
The Driving Engine SDK allows developers to gain insights into how a driver is operating their car. At Arity, we use this information to make informed decisions about driving behavior.

## Features
Using the Driving Engine SDK, you'll be able to
* Detect when a user starts and stops driving their car
* Detect hard accelerations
* Detect hard braking
* Detect when a user is speeding
* Get 1Hz GPS trails for a trip
